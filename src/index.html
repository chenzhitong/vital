You and your counterparty shall assume the liabilities and consequences of your transactions.</p>

When you use third-party-developed dapps and smart contracts integrated in Vital, Company strongly suggest you read the terms of service, privacy policy, and other relevant documents and information of such third-party-developed dapps and smart contracts carefully, get familiar with the counterparty and the product information and evaluate the risks before you make transactions on such dapps or smart contracts.

The Company shall not be held liable for any risks, responsibilities, losses or expenses occurred due to such transactions.</p>

Any and all losses arising in connection with the foregoing shall be borne solely by you.</p>
<p>6.6. We suggest you double back up your private key, recovery phrase or any account password when you create your account. We warn you not to use electronic methods such as screenshots, photo-taking, video-shoot, e-mails, note-taking apps in cell phones, text messages, WeChat or QQ to back up your private key, recovery phrase or any account password, nor to tell anyone including your relatives. We suggest you write it down on two papers and keep them separately in two different safe places.</p>
